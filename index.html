            <h2>
                When is the best time to have a tree removed from your property?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Duluth Tree Service is one of the most trusted companies when it comes to tree removal. We offer a wide range of services that can help you keep your trees healthy and looking great. However, there are times when it’s best to have a tree removed from your property. Here are some things to consider when making that decision.
            </p><br>
            <ul style="padding-left: 50px">
                <li>
                    The tree is diseased or dying. If a tree is sick or dying, it’s best to have it removed before it becomes a danger to your property or to passersby.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The tree is growing too close to power lines. Trees that are growing too close to power lines can pose a serious safety hazard. If you have a tree that is growing close to power lines, it’s best to have it removed before it becomes a problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The tree is blocking your view. If you have a tree that is blocking your view, it may be time to have it removed. Not only can this be a nuisance, but it can also be dangerous if you’re trying to see traffic when pulling out of your driveway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The tree is damaging your property. If a tree is damaging your property, it’s best to have it removed before the damage becomes too severe. This is especially true if the tree is causing cracks in your foundation or sidewalk.
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>
